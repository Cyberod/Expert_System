![](https://i2.wp.com/cateringbythefamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Simple-Dinner-Buffet-Menu.jpg)

This project was written in C programming Language, It is a Menu Banquet planner based on the nature of the event, the season (whatâ€™s obtainable) and the budget.This project isnt 100 percent efficient at the moment but will surely be made efficient.
The Banquet menu planner varies over three courses, the dishes are based on nigerian foods and the amount for each food is in Nigeria Naira. 
Each time the user is meant to give an input based on the instruction on the screen, The Menu Planner randomly selects dishes based on the the Budget(but not up to the budget, thus helping the user save money also) and Season.

### How to run the code
you can use any IDE that has a compiler (Preferably DevC++)

### Challenges Encountered
- Poor Workspace
- Little power Supply

### Things I will Upgrade
- The system still throws back dishes which were not randomly picked e.g 0 pot(s) of rice
- The code base needs to be optimised in terms of Length, space and speed.
